<p>Alex Russell's latest publication, 'poems about the rain', is a micro-collection of six short poems using weather to explore responses to the uncontrollable, with the speakers of the poems gradually shifting outlook across the piece.<br><br>Accompanying 'poems about the rain' is a series of visual poems and image macros, 'poems to place in the rain'. In congruence with the residency taking place through a vending machine intended for children's stickers, these works are shared as colourful weatherproof decals. <br><br>Each piece is an expression of love, longing, or a feeling of abundance, and those engaging with the work are invited to place them in spaces which risk being considered bleak and discouraging attention. When displayed publicly, the pieces hope to bring a point of brightness to the surroundings and invite reflection to observers.</p>
