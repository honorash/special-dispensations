    <p style="padding-left:15%;">“Madame Sosostris, famous clairvoyante,<br>
Had a bad cold, nevertheless<br>
Is known to be the wisest woman in Europe,<br>
With a wicked pack of cards. Here, said she,<br>
Is your card…”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30%;"><i>The Wasteland, T.S Eliot</i></p>
<p>Cross this vending machine with silver and writer and fortune teller Kym Deyn will tell you your future.</p>
<p>Inspired by folk wisdom, the mysteries of the tarot, and vintage fortune telling machines like the famous Zoltar, Kym has produced a series of fortune telling cards that include a micropoem, lucky numbers and inauspicious days.</p>
<p>These cards are placed at the intersection between poetry and serendipity, words and magic. They are for wondering, for lifting back the veil in the same way a child lifts a rock in the woods: to peer at something strange. Think of the delicious otherworld of the fairground, filled with lights and spun sugar, tightrope walkers and fortune tellers. The Vending Machine Oracle is filled too with old English folktales, lindworms and graveyard grims, stories from other times and still for this one. These cards are about escape as much as personal reflection. Whether they are the true words of an oracle, or the cheap natterings of a carnival mounteback is up to you. The Vending Machine Oracle simply says what she sees.</p>
